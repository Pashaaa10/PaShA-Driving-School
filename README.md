# What is this all about?

The project considers the management of data within a school for drivers, it being titled (for a bit of fun) PaShA.
About the application, it was made with the Python programming language (using Flasks). Not anything complex, just a simple application where I added some features such as "Insert", "Edit" and "Delete".
